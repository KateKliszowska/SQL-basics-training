# SQL Training Practice

This repository is a simple container for SQL queries. All of the queries placed in this repository are training queries written for practice reasons, working on an existing free-access database.

I'm using SQL in every day work, yet the Project I'm in de=oesn't give much chance for practicing more complex sql queriesm basically I'm using the SELECT statement foth filtering, UPDATE or DELETE for test data creation, yet practice is necessary and requires more complex commands as well.
